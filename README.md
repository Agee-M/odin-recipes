# odin-recipes

This is a project to introduce all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired thus far.
I'll be building a basic recipe site which will allow me to showcase:

- Different webpages and their interactions

- Integration of links, images and formatting techniques

- Good coding practices for basic HTML

This project will be used as a base for upcoming CSS knowledge.
