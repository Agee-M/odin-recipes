                <li>Poor your milk and oats into a bowl</li>
                    <ul><li>Your goal is to get the milk to cover the oats, but not make a soup</li></ul>

                        <li>It's always better to add milk after than to needing to reduce milk further.</li>
                    </li></ul>
