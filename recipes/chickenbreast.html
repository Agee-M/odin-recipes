            <li>Slice those bad boys in half through the side like a meat sandwich</li>
            <li>Even them out with your hands so they're flat</li>

            <li>Set the oven to 375 degrees F</li>
            <li>Set up your baking sheet with a little oil</li>
            <ul><li>You can add parchment paper for less clean-up!</li></ul>
            <li>Cook the chicken breast for about 13 minutes</li>
            <ul><li>It varies by thickness, so after 10 minutes check with your thermometer regularly! We want at least 155 degrees F</li></ul>
            <li>Pull out the deliciousness and let it rest for about 5-10 minutes so it stays juicy!</li>

            <h4>Optional:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Take it out at around 145 degrees F and fry the outside on a skillet!</li>
